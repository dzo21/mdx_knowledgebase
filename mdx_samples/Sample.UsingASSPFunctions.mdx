//GetEfficientToDateSet()
//
//This function returns the most efficient set representing all of time through the current member in the first Time dimension. If the first Time dimension contains more than one user-defined hierarchy, the hierarchy with the current member which is the most granular is chosen. (See GetMostGranularHierarchyCurrentMember below for more details.)
//
//This function is more flexible than GetEfficientPeriodsToDateSet because you do not have to specify a member. This flexibility could be handy in a situation where the Time dimension has more than one user-defined hierarchy (such as Calendar and Fiscal) by which an end user could slice the cube. Since it is not known in advance which hierarchy the end user will pick, this function could be used to correctly handle any slice they choose.

//
//This signature of the GetEfficientToDateSet function takes in a valid MDX member expression parameter specifying the member for which the "to date" set should be calculated. This parameter makes this signature slightly less expensive because the system does not have to search for the Time dimension and the system does not have to search for the most granular current member. Otherwise, the function acts the same as GetEfficientToDateSet(), though it is not as flexible in the situation of a dimension having multiple user-defined hierarchies unless the member expression conditionally evaluates to a member in the appropriate hierarchy.
